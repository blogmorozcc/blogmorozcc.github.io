## What is Docker and Docker Compose

Docker and Docker Compose are tools designed to simplify the process of managing and deploying applications in containers. Hereâ€™s an overview of each, along with their differences and key benefits.

### Docker

**Definition:**

Docker is a platform that uses containerization to deploy, manage, and run applications. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent environments that include everything needed to run a piece of software, such as the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

**Key Benefits:**

- Consistency: Docker ensures that software will run the same regardless of where it's deployed because containers encapsulate all dependencies.
- Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, which makes it easier to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
- Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, including on-premises servers, public clouds, and personal machines.
- Efficiency: Docker containers are lightweight and have lower overhead compared to traditional virtual machines.
- Scalability: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple containers across different hosts.

### Docker Compose

**Definition:**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes, allowing you to manage multiple containers as a single application.

**Key Benefits:**

- Simplified Configuration: Docker Compose uses a single YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to configure all your application's services, making it easier to manage and understand.
- Multi-Container Management: It allows you to define, run, and manage multiple interconnected containers with a single command (docker-compose up).
- Environment Consistency: Ensures consistent environments across different stages of development, testing, and production by using the same configuration file.
- Networking: Automatically sets up a network so that the containers can communicate with each other without additional configuration.
- Volume Management: Simplifies the setup and management of data volumes that can be shared between containers.

### Differences

- Scope: Docker is used for single-container applications, whereas Docker Compose is designed for applications consisting of multiple containers.
- Usage: Docker commands (docker run, docker build, etc.) are used to manage individual containers, while Docker Compose commands (docker-compose up, docker-compose down, etc.) manage entire multi-container applications defined in a YAML file.
- Configuration: Docker uses Dockerfiles to define container images, while Docker Compose uses a docker-compose.yml file to define multi-container applications, including their networks and volumes.

**Combined Key Benefits**

- Streamlined Development: Together, Docker and Docker Compose allow for rapid and consistent development, testing, and deployment of applications.
- Reproducibility: Both tools ensure that the environment in which the application runs is consistent across different stages, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.
- Simplified CI/CD: Integration with CI/CD pipelines becomes easier, as containers can be used to run tests and deploy applications in a consistent environment.
- Resource Efficiency: Containers share the same OS kernel and can be more resource-efficient than virtual machines.

### Practical example

Suppose you have a web application with the following components:

- A web server (e.g., Nginx)
- An application server (e.g., Node.js)
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

**With Docker:**

- You create individual Dockerfiles for each component to containerize them.

**With Docker Compose:**

- You create a docker-compose.yml file to define all three services and their interactions.
- You can bring up the entire stack with a single command (docker-compose up).

## Docker installation 

First of all update system packages to the latest vesions:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
{{< / highlight >}}

Then install necessary packages:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gnupg2
{{< / highlight >}}

Add GPG public key for official Docker repository:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
{{< / highlight >}}

Add the Docker debian repository to apt package manager sources list:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
{{< / highlight >}}

Update package indexes and install Docker Community Edition:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce
{{< / highlight >}}

Enable and start the docker systemd daemon:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
{{< / highlight >}}

Finally, verify the installation by running demo `hello-world` container:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo docker run hello-world
{{< / highlight >}}

## Docker Compose installation 

Download the latest release from official repository:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
{{< / highlight >}}

Add execution permissions to the downloaded binary:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
{{< / highlight >}}

Verify the installition by printing out Docker Compose version:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
docker compose --version
{{< / highlight >}}

In addition, you can create a test `docker-compose.yml` file with a couple of demo services (for example web server and database):

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  database:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

And then to start it use the command:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=false" >}}
docker compose up
{{< / highlight >}}

## Conclusion

This example illustrates how to install Docker and Docker Compose on Debian system to complement each other in developing, deploying, and managing applications efficiently.
